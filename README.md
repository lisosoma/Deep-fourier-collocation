# Deep-fourier-collocation

Under-resolved simulations of chaotic dynamics by deep spectral methods.

## Introduction

Chaotic dynamics is a popular object of research. For discribe chaotic dymanimcs by math ussualy used partial differectial equations (PDE). The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation will be considered as an object of chaotic dynamics research in this paper.
